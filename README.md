# CTF_EXPLORER

A smallish application for exploring CTF aliasing effects due to data collection
parameters as discussed
[here](https://forum.scilifelab.se/t/thinking-about-ctf/114).

## Requirements

It should be consistent across older versions of Python, but this was what I
tested it using:

 * Python (_Version >= 3.7.6_)
 * numpy (_Version >= 1.18.1_)
 * IPython (_Version >= 7.12.0_)
 * ipywidgets (_Version >= 7.5.1_)
 * plotly (_Version >= 4.8.1_)
 * appmode (_Version >= 0.8.0_)

## Usage

I will update this with a badge to Binder instance as soon as I get that sorted.
